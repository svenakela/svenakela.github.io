# How I write Tech Docs

This repository contains a complete setup for documenting with Asciidoc, built with Maven. It is also adjusted to make it easy to publish the pages as a github.io web page where all the content is stored in the `docs` directory.

## Content vs Formatting

Tech docs should be written in a data format with no formatting. Formatting occurs while building the documentation. If you're old enough to know LaTeX, you get get gist.

The full documentation is merged and rendered with the [Maven Site command](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/). How you do it it is up to you, there are many ways of running Asciidoc, bit this is how I do it.

You want to be able to create a PDF from your docs? PDF creation is easily made with the Maven Asciidoc plugin directly.

The content is written in any format [listed here](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/examples/creating-content.html) 
but I've decided to stay at Asciidoc for its rich format. These are my preferred formats:
- [Asciidoc](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/) - Initially made for tech writers with more complexity than markdown
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) - An extremely powerful ascii to graphic rendering

If several authors are writing text, there is no need for everyone to have Maven. The formats have preview functions in VS Code and 
it is therefore easy to write proper documentation with a preview of the output while writing.

## Search Function

When the site docs are being built with `make_me_a_docs_page.sh` there will be a search index generated. The search data is then used to serve a search function on the page, which is in the top menu. The search is based in [Mini Search](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minisearch) and is very powerful for such small library. This feature comes in handy when a site page is growing as there is no proper built in search function in static pages generated by Maven.

## Diagrams

### PlantUML
[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) is integrated in this repository. Diagram definitions are sourced in the `src/plantuml` directory and `[txt,uml,puml]` files in any sub directory will be rendered into a `generated-diagrams` folder while building the docs.

To be able to preview included diagrams, the rendering must be triggered.

- Asciidoc files are including the image directly, run the command `mvn generate-sources` and there will be a `generated-diagrams` directory in the root of the `asciidoc` folder

- Markdown links an href to the file and the image is not present until the site is rendered fully

There are preview extensions for most developer IDEs.

Add a diagram in an asciidoc document with following: `image::generated-diagrams/application-relations.svg[]`. The path is relative. The diagram should work in a preview.

Add a diagram in a markdown document with following: `![commentHere](generated-diagrams/nameOfDiagram.svg)`. Previews show a missing image icon until the page is built.

When linking a diagram in a document, the preview will be a not-found image. This is because the source is based on the target output. When the documents are built, the images will be correctly linked.

## Images

Images are stored in the `resources/img` directory and will be referenced as `/img/...` when the site is built. Unfortunately images will not be available in a preview without making a symlink between the resource and asciidoc folders.

## Content Structure

Documents are separated in a tree structure representing the file formats. Each file format has its own subfolder. PlantUML diagrams are generated in a pre-phase before the site documentation is generated and bundled.


```
+- src/
   +- plantuml/
   |  +- fancy-diagram.puml
   |  +- another-diagram.puml
   +- site/
      +- asciidoc/
      |  +- system-abc.adoc
      |
      +- fml/
      |  +- if-any-other-format-is-used-it-will-be-in-a-subfolder.fml
      |  +- security/
      |     +- what-is-security.fml
      |
      +- markdown/
      |  +- introduction.md
      |  +- security/
      |     +- monitoring.md
      |
      +- resources/
      |  +- ...
      |
      +- site.xml
```

When the documentation is created and bundled the format structure is stripped and all documents are merged into one tree structure. This means that a subsystem can be documented with several file formats. In the example above there are security subfolders in both `FML` and `markdown`. These documents will be bundled as:

```
+- site\
   +- security\
      +- monitoring.html
      +- what-is-security.html
   +- diagrams\
      +- security-protocol.svg
```

As a tech writer, you are not bound to a specific file format. Choose the format that has the best fit for the content.

## Build

Note: Following is not necessary to make content. All previews in IDEs are good enough to maintain the docs.

### Requirements

- Java, best way to install is via [SDK Man](https://sdkman.io/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), the java build project
- Dot, a part of the [Graphviz toolkit](https://graphviz.org/)

### Commands

`make_me_a_docs_page.sh` will recreate the entire docs page for you.

The `mvn process-resources` command generates images from PlantUml diagrams.

The `mvn site` command generates all pages from all different docs files and these will be bundled as a static web site in the `docs` folder.

## Linking
All HTML menus are built from the `src/site/site.xml` definition. Any new document that should be in a menu must be added here.

# Technical Writing Standards

Google offers a complete Technical Writing course with pre-studies, slide decks and Youtube videos all for free. 
To keep a high standard and persistent feeling of the documentation, all authors should complete this course.
